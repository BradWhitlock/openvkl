Support and Contact
-------------------

Open VKL is under active development, and though we do our best to guarantee
stable release versions a certain number of bugs, as-yet-missing features,
inconsistencies, or any other issues are still possible. Should you find any
such issues please report them immediately via [Open VKL's GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/OpenVKL/openvkl/issues) (or, if you should happen to
have a fix for it, you can also send us a pull request); you may also contact us
via email at <openvkl@googlegroups.com>.
